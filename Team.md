# Work Breakdown for MP5

## Maria Sottile (12746160) and Ge (Jessica) Ma (11717162)

Overall comments: 

For the most part, we tried to work on the MP together. For part 1 this was easy to do. For part 2, we each took an algorithm then later went back over eachother's work. We both started on part 3, then divided the work on the server and the work on structured queries as outlined below. For test cases, we mostly wrote our own cases for the methods we authored, but checking these tests and cleaning up code was a team effort. 

### Jessica:

- `YelpDB`, `datatypes`, `k-means`, `YelpDBServer`, `Client` (and all other clients)
- `ServerTests`, `YelpDBTests`, `MoreYelpDBTests`, `QueryTests`, looked over other tests
- visualizer for k-means, testing the server from command line
- Part III and IV


### Maria:

- `YelpDB`, helped edit `datatypes`, `getPredictorFunction`, helped with `k-means`, `antlr`
- `LeastSquaresTests`, `QueryTests`, helped with `YelpDBTests`, `MoreYelpDBTests`
- looked over code for clean up, specs, RIs, AFs
- Part V


### Time spent:

Part I took around 5 hours in about a day or two, but was edited throughout

Part II took around 20-25 hours over about a week

Part III took around 10 hours over a couple of days

Part IV took at least 14-20 hours over several days

Part V took at least 24-30 hours over several days
